        <p>

        <p class="right">
            <img src="dessert.image/large  kunafa.jpg" alt="kunafa">
        </p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>1/2 kilo kunafa</li>
               <li>250 gm butter</li>
               <li>200 gm cream</li>
               <li>200 ricotta cheese</li>
               <li>For Syrup: 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup water and juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Method:</h3>
            <p>Warm the oven to 350°. Melt or soften butter in a pan. Shred the Kunafa either by hand or with scissors. 
Then, mix it well with butter. Divide Kunafa in two halves. Lay one half in a round or a rectangular pan, and then press gently with the palm of your hand on the surface.
Save the other half.  Meanwhile mix The Ricotta Cheese with cream in a bowl. (Some people prefer to put a little less cheese then the cream).
 With a spoon spread cheese mixture on the Kunafa;laying out evenly with the back of the spoon.
Lay the other half of the Kunafa on top of the filling then again press down gently with the palm of your hand and push into the oven. Depending on the pan you use,
 (I use Tefal), I get it out when its sides shrink and turn into a dark golden color. Flip on prepared serving plate with golden bottom side up, leave it to cool for a minute then pour cold syrup all over. If your pan is aluminum its surface might turn gold first
  (I haven’t tried- I’d appreciate it someone lets me know what happens in an aluminum pans).</p>
           <h3>Syrup:</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>Heat mixed sugar and water until sugar completely dissolves.</li>
               <li>Add lemon juice.</li>
               <li>Leave to boil until mixture thickens.</li>
               <li>Test that it is the right thickness by putting a drop on a tilted surface, if it’s runny, and then leave it some more. If it’s kind of 
heavy and doesn’t really run then you are done. Leave mixture to cool completely before adding to Kunafa.</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>Hints:</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>Dip the spoon in a glass of water before spreading the cheese mixture; otherwise the filling will stick to the spoon along with the Kunafa.</li>
               <li>Either the syrup or the Kunafa must be very hot when combining, otherwise things will get soggy.</li>
               <li>You don’t have to use all the syrup, but pour enough to make it moist/ or to taste. You could always heat the syrup and add later when Kunafa cools to adjust to our taste.</li>
           </ul>

            <li>3/4 cup butter or ghee</li>
            <li>1 cup greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking  powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tahini sauce</li>
            <li>Zest of one orange (optional)</li>
            <li>Peeled slivered almonds for decoration</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of tahini to brush baking dish</li>
            <li>Sugar syrup for drizzling</li>
            <li>Ground pistachio</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>
            Mix the semolina,butter, yogurt, juice, sugar, baking powder, tahini and orange zest in a pot until homogeneous

            Brush a baking dish with tahini
            
            Pour the batter into the baking dish
            
            Level the surface using a wet hand
            
            Use a wet line to make cuts in the pattern that you like
            
            You can find step by step picture instructions on how to make this particular pattern here.
            
            Decorate with peeled almonds
            
            Bake on the bottom rack of a preheated oven at 180 until the edges are golden brown (about 30 minutes)
            
            Place under the broiler until the top is golden brown
            
            Take out of the oven and allow it to cool for 5 minutes
            
            Drizzle with syrup (the amount depends on how sweet you want the harissa to be. Do remember that harissa needs to be hot and the syrup needs to be room temperature)
            
            Decorate with ground pistachio
            
            Serve one the Harissa is room temperature

        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups All-purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp. Baking Powder</li>
            <li>2 tb. White Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1½ cups Water Room Temp.</li>
            <li>2 cups Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup Nestle Table Cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup Crushed Pistachios</li>
            <li>Rose Water Simple Syrup For serving</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>
            Begin by placing all the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisking together. Add the water and mix well. 
            The mixture should be similar to a runnier pancake batter. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes.
            Heat up a non-stick pan medium-low heat. Drop 1 tablespoon of batter and spread lightly using the bottom of your spoon or ladle.
The Atayef will begin to bubble. Once there is no more shiny (raw batter) areas, remove the pancake using a spatula and place on a
 light kitchen towel or paper towels.The Atayef should cook for 1-2 minutes.To prepare the filling, add the ricotta and table cream to
  a small bowl and mix together. Add a tablespoon of the rose-water simple syrup to the filling to give it a wonderful rose water aroma. *This is Optional
  Once the Atayef have fully cooled, place about 1 tablespoon of filling on the pancake and pinch the sides together to close it 
  ¾ of the way.*Skim or low fat ricotta may be substituted but I HIGHLY recommend using full-fat
  Dip the open area into the crushed pistachios.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>25–30 sheets of phyllo dough</li>
            <li>500g (17 oz.) walnuts, chopped (or a mix of walnuts, pistachios and almonds)</li>
            <li>2 tsps cinnamon powder</li>
            <li>2 tsps grounded clove</li>
            <li>300g butter, melted (10 oz.)</li>
            <li>some whole cloves for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>
Prepare the Spiced Nut Filling Place walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a food processor:
Pulse about 10 times, until the walnuts are well chopped:Begin building the layers 
Place layers of thawed phyllo dough down into your pan, brushing each one with melted butter:
You don’t need to brush each layer thoroughly. Just a quick swish across several times, to cover most of it.
Assembling the baklava, you want to move relatively quickly, to prevent the phyllo from drying out, so no need to be meticulous with the butter.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g (3 cups) medium grind white semolina (semeed NOT basbousa mix)*</li>
            <li>150g (2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon) ghee, melted</li>
            <li>50g (1/3 cup packed) unsweetened shredded coconut (aka desiccated coconut),(optional but highly recommended; could be reduced) </li>
            <li>150g (2/3 cup) whole milk</li>
            <li>100g (1/3 cup) heavy sugar syrup (recipe below; may be substituted with Big Batch Sugar Syrup</li>
            <li>250g (1 1/4 cup) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee, for brushing over the basbousa (optional)</li>
            <li>150g raw nuts, like hazelnuts or almonds, blanched and coarsely chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh eshta (country clotted cream), for serving, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>
In goes the coconut; that optional (but not really) ingredient. Before I add it in, I like to shred 
it even finer in the food processor, so I don’t get obvious long strands in the final product.  After that, you’ll want to leave 
the mixture to hang out together until you prepare the liquid ingredients.In a measuring cup, the milk, sugar and heavy sugar syrup go in together,
 then microwaved until very warm Then whisked together until all the sugar granules dissolve completely.Liquid goes into the dry…Then folded in ever so gently.  Don’t forget we’re dealing with a gluten monster here that were trying to tame.  So the less you handle the batter, the better.  
 Overmixing increases gluten development, so you just want to mix until no pockets of dry ingredients remain. Now pour the batter into a baking pan that’s
been greased with ghee…don’t listen to anyone who tells you to grease the pan with tahini.  Lies, lies, lies!  I actually tested it out in what was probably
 my 51st trail and it made the basbousa taste like tahini.  So unless you want a tahini flavored basbousa, go with ghee.  Tap the pan over the counter several times to smooth.  Then refrigerate until the batter is no longer jiggly;
  that should take about 15-20 minutes.  This resting step allows the liquids to hydrate and expand the semolina grains, which makes for a finer texture
  If you love nuts; go nuts!  Hazelnut is probably the most common nut topping.  For some people, a basbousa doesn’t count if it’s
not covered in nuts…I’m not one of those people.  Refrigerate that as well then bake! When it comes out of  the oven, it will look like a dry land in
the peak of drought.  So immediately quench its thirst with the cooled light soaking syrup And forget about it for at least 30 minute to cool down a bit
 and give the semolina grains some time to drink up all the syrup and puff up and become nice and soft hen prepare to be amazed by how the knife glides into it like butter.  
 I love it while still slightly warm…with a dollop of eshta on top. YUM!

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g/1lb palmiers (also known as lunettes), storebought or homemade*</li>
            <li> 1 liter/1 quart (4 1/4 cups) full fat milk, preferably organic buffalo*</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>250g/8oz (1 cup) fresh eshta balady (country-style clotted cream) or 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 
            (whipped to medium peaks)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>
Once you get your hands on some palmiers, fresh (preferably organic buffalo) milk, eshta (or whipped cream),
 sugar and nuts, this dessert is easy as throwing everything in a pan.
You’ll just break some palmiers in a baking dish (forget the pictures, and use a shallow rectangular dish instead of a deep one for better texture.
I was going for a country Egyptian look by using a traditional deep dish, but I found that a shallow one gives more surface area for a crunchier top).  
 Then all you’ll need to do, is boil the milk with some sugar, then pour it all over two-thirds the amount palmiers.  Note that I’m not adding the nuts 
 at this stage, which is the traditional route, because some people (like someone I know) have nut issues.  But if you like them inside, go ahead and knock yourself out!
 Then top with the remaining one-third of palmiers.  This will give you an extra-crunchy topping. Yum!  My favorite part. You’ll then dot the surface with eshta (country-style clotted cream),
  no worries if you can’t find it, whipped cream works just as well.  This will melt under the broiler and browns to a beautiful golden brown color  
        </p>
        <h3>Optional assorted nuts of your choice:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (57g) toasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup (57g) pistachios, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (75g) raisins</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (20g) shredded coconut</li>
